# eclipse macro plugin
The eclipse macro plugin can be used to record and play macros.

It was originally developed in the [eclipse e4 project](https://git.eclipse.org/r/plugins/gitiles/e4/org.eclipse.e4.ui/+/refs/heads/master/bundles/org.eclipse.e4.core.macros) and released as [Eclipse Macros Incubation plugin](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/eclipse-macros-incubation), but was abandoned.

This fork is mainly intended to make the plugin work again with new versions.
